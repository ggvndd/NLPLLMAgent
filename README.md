   ```
   
   **For Production (With Real API Keys):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your actual API keys
   ```

4. **Configure your .env file:**

   ```env
   LLM_PROVIDER=demo
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=demo_token
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```
   
   **Production Mode (.env.example):**
   ```env
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai  # or anthropic
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```

## Usage

### CLI Mode (Direct Agent Interaction)

Run the career agent directly for testing:

```bash
python src/career_agent.py
```

### Discord Bot Mode

Start the Discord bot:

```bash
python src/discord_bot.py
```

### Discord Commands

Once the bot is running in your Discord server, use these commands:

- `!career_analyze <skills>` - Analyze career paths based on your skills
- `!resume_review` - Get resume improvement suggestions (attach your resume)
- `!job_match <preferences>` - Find matching job opportunities
- `!mock_interview <role>` - Start a mock interview simulation
- `!skill_gap <target_role>` - Analyze skills needed for a target role
- `!help` - Show all available commands

### Example Usage

```
!career_analyze "Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis"
!job_match "Remote, Tech Industry, $80k+"
!mock_interview "Software Engineer"
!skill_gap "Data Scientist"
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_career_agent.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src
```

## Logging

The application creates log files in the `logs/` directory:

- `career_agent.log` - General application logs
- `discord_bot.log` - Discord bot specific logs
- `errors.log` - Error-only logs

Log levels can be configured via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not responding**: Check Discord bot token and permissions
2. **API errors**: Verify OpenAI/Anthropic API keys are valid
3. **Import errors**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed

### Getting Help

- Check the logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed error information
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- Verify API keys have sufficient credits/permissions

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Add core logic to `src/career_agent.py`
2. Add Discord commands to `src/discord_bot.py`
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Update documentation

### Architecture Notes

- The career agent uses modular design for easy extension
- Discord bot is built with discord.py for robust async operations
- Configuration is centralized and environment-based
- Logging is structured and configurable
- Tests cover both unit and integration scenarios
